            <p>Self Reflection / Reflective Essay</p>
            <p>
                The Media and Information Literacy (MIL) course under Ms. Camille C. Cano was a challenging but valuable
                learning experience for me. One of the biggest struggles I faced was understanding the complexity of the media
                landscape and the various biases and perspectives present in different sources of information. However, Ms. Cano's
                approach of fostering class discussions and group projects helped me develop critical thinking skills and learn how 
                to evaluate and analyze different sources of information.<br><br>

                Another challenge I faced was keeping up with the constant influx of information and staying current on current events.
                Ms. Cano's approach of incorporating current events into class discussions and assignments helped me to develop a deeper
                understanding of the material and become more aware of the issues happening in the world.<br><br>

                Overall, the MIL course under Ms. Cano's guidance has had a significant impact on me as a student. It has helped 
                me become more media literate and better equipped to navigate the information landscape with a critical perspective.
                The class has also helped me to stay informed about current events and develop critical thinking skills.           
            </p>

            <p>Navigating the Digital World: Mastering Media and Information Literacy</p>
            <p>Stay informed, stay connected. Develop your media and information literacy skills and stay up-to-date 
            with accurate, credible information. Together, we can build a more informed and engaged community.</p>
